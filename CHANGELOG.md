- ### Update and remove tag strips
  Updated the two column tag strip to allow the events calendar.
  
  Removed the strip from the other layouts (one column, three column, four column, and edge-to-edge) because they do not need the check as their columns don't expand like the two column does.

  Resolves #69

- ### Background images fix
  These changes fix background images for the multicolumn layouts. 
  Added back in are the overlay options, scroll effect options, as well as actually applying these options to the section.
  
  Resolves #67
---

- ### Update layout--two-column.html.twig
  The `flex-grow-1` was dropped from the rework of the layouts. 
  This adds that back for the two column layout which makes it so empty columns don't take up space.
  
  Resolves #65 
---

- ### Column Refactor + Jumpmenu update
  Big refactors to how columns are built to be more dynamic rather than prewritten divs per column. This decision was made to cleanup the code and to add in information for column eminence. Main and auxiliary columns need to be labeled as such for jump navs to render properly.
  
  The column eminence mainly affects the two and three column layouts as they can have varying sizes based on user choice. Equal width columns (6-6 and 4-4-4) are treated all as "main"
  
  When testing please test all the layout options for columns in the layout builder.
  I don't think I missed any of the layout options in my refactor but double checks would be helpful.

  Resolves #63

- ### two column layout striptag update
  Re-adding the missing `<slate-form>` check that is necessary for the slate forms to load if they are the only content in the first column.
  
  Resolves #61 
---

- ### Updates linter workflow
  Updates the linter workflow to use the new parent workflow in action-collection.
  
  CuBoulder/action-collection#7
  
  Sister PR in: All the things
---

- ### Update layout--two-column.html.twig
  Add `<slate-form>` to the striptags so that forms in the second column aren't removed in the check for content.
  
  Test by adding a slate form into the second column of a section. The section should have no other content including a title for the slate form block. The slate form should appear as expected.
  
  Resolves https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/issues/1363
---

- ### Create developer-sandbox-ci.yml
  new ci workflow
---

- ### Update LayoutBase.php
  Update section background to use specific style (section_background)
  New image style scales width to 1920, but does not crop the height at all.
  
  Because the section background focal point information is % relative this change does not affect or break the previous work done to apply focal positioning of the image.
  
  Note:
  If you have a section background already made for a section you will need to first clear caches, then save your section's configuration again to populate the new image style URL. 
  
  Sister PR: https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-custom-entities/pull/173
---

- ### Equal Column Height
  Added a form option on sections for equal column height. This option only shows up for 2, 3, and 4 column options. All blocks within the column will be made equal height flex items.
  
  In Layout Builder the "Add Block" button is unfortunately a flex item as well and so the preview differs slightly with the saved layout.
  
  Closes #54 
---

- ### Update LayoutBase.php
  Grab focal point positioning for background images and apply it so that tablet and mobile views display better.
  
  Resolves #52 
---

- ### Added tablet and mobile padding
  Added tablet and mobile spacing for section layouts. This requires inline css to be applied at the template level to allow for proper breakpoints. Tablet and mobile are both under the "Spacing" dropdown but also contained within their own drop downs to keep the UI clean. Unique ids are being generated at the module level for the layout builder sections so that styles can be applied properly. IDs can't be grabbed via twig at the layout builder level for unknowable reasons.
  
  Resolves #50

-   ### Class fixes and additions

    Fixed a name error from `boostrap` -> `bootstrap`
    Added new unstyled/styled class names for frames

-   ### Update layout--two-column.html.twig

    Sister PR: <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/pull/898>
    Sister PR: <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat10-profile/pull/119>
    Sister PR: <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-custom-entities/pull/135>

    Updated two column layout to be flex-grow-1 for each column and to check if the column is empty (mainly for the sake of empty menus) for rendering purposes.
    This is for the new default layout of the basic page.

* * *

-   ### Frame syntax fix
    Spaces needed to be added to these two rows because they were breaking the styles of the section.

* * *

-   ### Update ucb_bootstrap_layouts.module

    Hooks to remove contextual links everywhere but the layout builder pages.

    Sister PR: <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/pull/870>

-   ### Light overlay update

    Modifies the Light Overlay on section background images to be more white than gray so particularly light background images are no longer darkened by the overlay due

    Resolves #32 

* * *

-   ### edge-to-edge update

    Set up `edge-to-edge` as a separate layout rather than a sub-option for `one column`

    It is technically a "13 column" row for the sake of UCBLayout and LayoutBase as to differentiate form options between it and the `one column`

    Edge-to-edge does not have the normal form options all the other layouts have but instead just receives defaults for said options. These defaults are passed into the template so everything is "filled out" properly.

    Icon on column choice is the same as `One Column` because those icons are made automatically through layout builder based on number of rows in the section.

    A test of creating a current single column row with edge-to-edge option, and then updating to the newest code would be good to see how this is going to affect our current sandboxes. 
    The site does not break but users will be unable to choose `edge-to-edge` as an option anymore in the `one column` sections. If someone edits a previous `edge-to-edge one column` the form will override to the default `100% contained width` thereby switching it away from `edge-to-edge`. This is a manual process and will not automatically switch after this update is rolled out.

    Order of section options:

## [20231212] - 2023-12-12

-   ### Fixed Frame and Overlay

    Fixed framing for single column rows (the frame wasn't showing on single column rows) 

    -   test this by adding a content frame

    Added a new default for overlay classes. (caused css issues)

    -   This one is harder to actually see the results of because nothing should happen when you select overlays without images

    Closes #21 

* * *

-   ### Update LayoutBase.php

    Added an else statement to apply padding to section even when background images aren't used

    Closes #17 

* * *

-   ### Issue/471

    Updated edge-to-edge option for single column layouts
    Makes hero units, video reveals, and sliders work as full width sections.

    Sister PR: <https://github.com/CuBoulder/tiamat-theme/pull/474>

* * *

-   ### Fix Frames

    Fixed the frames so that the bootstrap columns work properly

    Closes #14 

* * *

-   ### Content Frame Update

    Added option for frame color to the background options of layout builder when creating or editing a Section.

    Choosing the light option keeps text black.
    Choosing the dark option sets the text to white.
    We will probably need to edit some css for certain blocks but we'll take that case by case.

    Closes #12 

* * *

-   ### Adds `CHANGELOG.MD` and workflows; updates `core_version_requirement` to indicate D10 compatibility
    Additionally uses "CU Boulder" package and adds additional supporting files to match our other custom modules. Resolves CuBoulder/ucb_bootstrap_layouts#10
